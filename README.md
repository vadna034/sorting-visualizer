# [Sorting visualization](https://sorting-visualization-c311e.web.app/)

Threw this project together to show that I know about a few sorting algorithms + am skilled enough with TypeScript to handle promises, etc. 

The site showcases a few famous sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, etc) and animates it using a graph of elements. You can change both the number of elements, and the animation speed by moving the sliders at the top, and you can pause or resume the animation by hitting the pause and resume buttons below the graph.
